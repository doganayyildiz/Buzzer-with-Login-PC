# Buzzer-with-Login-PC
I wanted to enter the computer password in a different way.
When the buzzer is hit, there is a voltage surge between the poles of the buzzer.
We can use this surge as a morse signal.

What we have to do is read this surge as analog and then set a rythm.
We have to sync the password to this rhythm.
